# Painter Style Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks
The Painter Style Recognition project focuses on utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Fine Tuning techniques to classify photos of paintings from three distinct artists: Caravaggio, Manet, and Van Gogh. The project's objective is to train a model capable of accurately identifying the author of a given painting.

A critical aspect of the project involved constructing a comprehensive and robust dataset. This dataset needed to encompass a wide range of scenes representing various genres, including religious subjects, still life, and landscapes. Additionally, the dataset included images captured from different angles, encompassing both the frame and background of the paintings. To further challenge the model's classification abilities, images with occlusions, such as overlaid text, were introduced.

The project report includes an in-depth analysis of the dataset, detailing its composition and division. It also outlines the selected architecture for the CNN model and presents the results achieved through training and evaluation.

Furthermore, the report delves into the key techniques employed for image classification, including Fine Tuning strategies, and discusses the countermeasures implemented to enhance model performance.

By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and a meticulously curated dataset, the Painter Style Recognition project aims to contribute to the field of art classification and pave the way for future advancements in automated art analysis and authentication.
